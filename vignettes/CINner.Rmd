# Set up CINner

CINner requires a number of input parameters about the assumed characteristics of tumor growth. 
One easy method to load the parameters to `CINner` is by creating `model_variables`, 
a list containing relevant variables in a specific order.
Here we detail how to create `model_variables`.

## 1. General variables for every cell

### 1a. Tissue-specific and sampling variables

We first specify the cell lifespan, measured in days.
`cell_lifespan` is the mean of the exponentially distributed lifetime of every cell during cancer evolution, 
independent of their particular cellular profiles.

```{r}
cell_lifespan <- 30
```
