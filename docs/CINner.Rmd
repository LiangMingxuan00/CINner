# Set up CINner

CINner requires a number of input parameters for the assumed characteristics of tumor growth. 
One easy method to load the parameters to `CINner` is by creating `model_variables`, 
a list containing relevant variables in a specific order.
Here we detail how to create `model_variables`.

## 1. General variables for every cell

### 1a. Tissue-specific and sampling variables

We first specify `cell_lifespan`, the mean of the exponentially distributed lifetime of every cell during cancer evolution, 
independent of their particular cellular profiles (measured in days).

```{r}
cell_lifespan <- 30
```

Next, we specify the time points at the beginning and the end of each simulation. 
The unit can be

- `day`
- `week` (= 7 days)
- `month` (= 30 days), or
- `year` (= 365 days). 

The unit for `T_0` and `T_end` should be consistent.

```{r}
T_0 <- list(0, "year")
T_end <- list(80, "year")
```

`Table_sample` details the time point that the DNA sample is taken (in the same unit as `T_0` and `T_end`), 
how many cells are in the sample, and the sample's ID.
The following code specifies that the sample in each CINner simulation
is to be labeled "SA01" and consist of 300 cells, taken at 80 years.

```{r}
Table_sample <- data.frame(
    Sample_ID = "SA01",
    Cell_count = 300,
    Age_sample = 80
)
```

CINner's efficiency is based partially on its use of the tau-leaping algorithm, 
instead of the exact Gillespie algorithm. 
As such, it requires a suggested `T_tau_step`.
Each CINner result then simulates the cell population starting from `T_0` at time points `T_0 + T_tau_step`, `T_0 + 2 * T_tau_step`, ..., 
until it reaches `T_end`.
If not specified, `T_tau_step` is automatically set to be `cell_lifespan / 2`. 
High time steps will lead to decreased simulation run time, but the simulations might not be statistically accurate.
Low time steps will lead to longer run time, but the simulations will be more reliable.

```{r}
T_tau_step <- cell_lifespan / 2
```

To speed up the simulations and in accordance with currently available DNA data, 
the genome is divided into bins of equal lengths (measured in number of nucleotides).
The CN profile of each cell is represented as a group of vectors,
each of which corresponds to one chromosome homolog and consists of the CN of each bin.
If not specified, `CN_bin_length` is automatically set to 500,000 nucleotides.

```{r}
CN_bin_length <- 500000
```

Three selection models are included in `CINner`:

- `chrom-arm-selection` models the selection for gains and losses of chromosome arms,
depending on their genetic imbalances.
This model requires additional probabilities in Section 1b and selection parameters in Section 2a.
- `driver-gene-selection` models the selection for gains, losses and mutations of specific driver genes.
This model requires additional probabilities in Section 1c and selection parameters in Section 2b.
- `chrom-arm-and-driver-gene-selection` combines `chrom-arm-selection` and `driver-gene-selection` into a hybrid model, where cancer is driven both by large-scale genetic imbalance at whole-chromosome and chromosome-arm level and focal events targeting specific genes.
This model requires additional probabilities in Sections 1b-c and selection parameters in Sections 2a-b.

For generality, we will employ `chrom-arm-and-driver-gene-selection`.

```{r}
selection_model <- "chrom-arm-and-driver-gene-selection"
```

### 1b. Occurence rates and length distributions of copy number aberrations (CNAs)

For `selection_model` = `chrom-arm-selection` or `chrom-arm-and-driver-gene-selection`, we need to specify the probabilities that each CNA mechanism occurs in a mitotic division.
These events have an impact on the fitness of the progeny cells and therefore the selection landscape.
There are three large-scale CNA mechanisms:

- Whole Genome Duplication (WGD) results in one progeny cell with double the genomic material of the parent cell.
- Missegregation targets a uniformly chosen chromosome homolog, which is then gained in one progeny cell and lost in the other.
- The same occurs for chromosome-arm missegregation, but only for one of the chromosome's arms (selected with equal probabilities).

The regional events target a randomly chosen region in a uniformly selected chromosome arm in one of the progeny cells. 
All of these events require additional parameters for the region length distributions, to be discussed next. 
There are two regional CNA mechanisms: focal amplification and deletion, which duplicate or delete the region respectively.

Unspecified CNA probabilities in CINner will be set to 0 by default.

```{r}
prob_CN_whole_genome_duplication <- 0.5e-4
prob_CN_missegregation <- 2e-4
prob_CN_chrom_arm_missegregation <- 2e-4
prob_CN_focal_amplification <- 0
prob_CN_focal_deletion <- 0
```

In specific applications, we might also consider neutral versions of the aforementioned CNA mechanisms.
These events change the CN profiles of the progeny cells without affecting their fitness.
The rules dictating how the progeny cells' CN profiles change as a result of neutral CNAs are similar to the selective CNA mechanisms above,
including the additional parameters specifying the region length distributions of the regional CNA events.

```{r}
prob_neutral_CN_whole_genome_duplication <- 0
prob_neutral_CN_missegregation <- 0
prob_neutral_CN_chrom_arm_missegregation <- 0
prob_neutral_CN_focal_amplification <- 0
prob_neutral_CN_focal_deletion <- 0
```

We now specify the parameters for the region length distributions of the regional CNA mechanisms.
For a given regional CNA mechanism `X` (= `CN_focal_amplification_length` or `CN_focal_deletion_length`), we can choose between two distributions:

- `model_X` = `geom`: the targeted region length is geometrically distributed, with the rate given by another parameter `prob_X` (unit is bin counts).
- `model_X` = `beta`: the ratio of the targeted region length over the chromosome arm follows the Beta distribution.
This requires two parameters for the Beta distribution, given by `prob_X_shape_1` and `prob_X_shape_2`.

```{r}
model_CN_focal_amplification_length <- "geom"
prob_CN_focal_amplification_length <- 10
model_CN_focal_deletion_length <- "beta"
prob_CN_focal_deletion_length_shape_1 <- 1
prob_CN_focal_deletion_length_shape_2 <- 7
```

### 1c. Occurence rate of driver and passenger mutations

For `selection_model` = `driver-gene-selection` or `chrom-arm-and-driver-gene-selection`, we need to specify the rate of driver mutations (per nucleotide per division).
If a driver mutation occurs, the gene to be mutated is chosen from an input list of driver genes (to be discussed next), excluding the genes already mutated in the cell. 
A cell's fitness increases with the number of driver mutations it has acquired.

```{r}
rate_driver <- 0
```

The rate of passenger mutations is likewise per nucleotide per division. However, passenger mutations do not change the cell's fitness.

```{r}
rate_passenger <- 1e-11
```

### 1d. Viability conditions

Cells increase their fitness by acquiring favorable CNAs and driver mutations. 
However, they are also subject to viability conditions. 
If it violates any of these conditions, a cell is deemed unviable and its fitness is set to 0, therefore will die:

- `bound_driver` is the upper bound on how many driver mutations the cell has acquired.
- `bound_average_ploidy` is the upper bound on the ploidy (i.e. average CN among all bins) of the cell.
- `bound_maximum_CN` is the upper bound on the CN in any bin in the cell.
- `bound_homozygosity` is the upper bound on the number of bins with homozygosity (i.e. bins with CN=0).

```{r}
bound_driver <- 3
bound_average_ploidy <- 4.5
bound_maximum_CN <- 8
bound_homozygosity <- 0
```
### 1e. Population dynamics

CINner simulations are designed to follow any population dynamic (limited by how fast the cells can divide or die, defined by their lifespan). 
The dataframe `table_population_dynamics` lists the expected total cell counts at corresponding time points.
The expected population size in the CINner simulations at any time point is interpolated from the two nearest time points in this variable.

Here, we expect the cell population to follow a logistic expansion, growing from 20 cells at `T_0` to 10000 cells at `T_end`, with the midpoint at 20 years.

```{r}
table_population_dynamics <- cbind(
    vec_time = T_0[[1]]:T_end[[1]],
    vec_cell_count = 10000 / (1 + exp(-0.3 * ((T_0[[1]]:T_end[[1]]) - 20)))
)
```

### 1f. Initiate CINner model variables

Finally, we use function `BUILD_general_variables` to initiate `model_variables`, a list object containing all variables described thus far:

```{r}
model_variables <- BUILD_general_variables(
    cell_lifespan = cell_lifespan,
    T_0 = T_0, T_end = T_end, T_tau_step = T_tau_step,
    Table_sample = Table_sample,
    CN_bin_length = CN_bin_length,
    prob_CN_whole_genome_duplication = prob_CN_whole_genome_duplication,
    prob_CN_missegregation = prob_CN_missegregation,
    prob_CN_chrom_arm_missegregation = prob_CN_chrom_arm_missegregation,
    prob_CN_focal_amplification = prob_CN_focal_amplification,
    prob_CN_focal_deletion = prob_CN_focal_deletion,
    prob_neutral_CN_whole_genome_duplication = prob_neutral_CN_whole_genome_duplication,
    prob_neutral_CN_missegregation = prob_neutral_CN_missegregation,
    prob_neutral_CN_chrom_arm_missegregation = prob_neutral_CN_chrom_arm_missegregation,
    prob_neutral_CN_focal_amplification = prob_neutral_CN_focal_amplification,
    prob_neutral_CN_focal_deletion = prob_neutral_CN_focal_deletion,
    model_CN_focal_amplification_length = model_CN_focal_amplification_length,
    model_CN_focal_deletion_length = model_CN_focal_deletion_length,
    prob_CN_focal_amplification_length = prob_CN_focal_amplification_length,
    prob_CN_focal_deletion_length_shape_1 = prob_CN_focal_deletion_length_shape_1,
    prob_CN_focal_deletion_length_shape_2 = prob_CN_focal_deletion_length_shape_2,
    rate_driver = rate_driver,
    rate_passenger = rate_passenger,
    selection_model = selection_model,
    bound_driver = bound_driver,
    bound_average_ploidy = bound_average_ploidy,
    bound_homozygosity = bound_homozygosity,
    table_population_dynamics = table_population_dynamics
)
```
## 2. Selection rates

Depending on which selection model is specified in the variable `selection_model` to drive cancer evolution, we need to define the selection rates of each chromosome arm and/or each driver gene, 
which then define a cell's fitness as it acquires new CNAs and/or driver mutations.

### 2a. Chromosome arm selection rates

If `selection_model` = `chrom-arm-selection` or `chrom-arm-and-driver-gene-selection`, then cancer is driven solely or partially by gains and losses of chromosome arms, based on their gene imbalances.

Each row in `table_arm_selection_rates` details the information for one chromosome arm.
Its ID is listed in column `Arm_ID`, and its location is recorded in columns `Chromosome`, `Bin_start` and `Bin_end`.
Its selection rate is specified in column `s_rate` as a positive number.

- Arms with more Tumor Suppressor Genes (TSGs) than Oncogenes (OGs) have selection rate less than 1, for which losses are advantageous and gains are deleterious. 
- Arms with more OGs than TSGs have selection rate higher than 1, for which gains are advantageous and losses are deleterious. 

The strength of the selection force depends on the distance between the selection rate to 1:

- Chromosome arms with very small or very large selection rates are strongly selected for
- Chromosome arms with selection rates very close to 1 are essentially neutral.

Here, we randomly assign selection rate from a uniform distribution from 1/1.2 to 1.2 for each chromosome arm.

```{r}
table_arm_selection_rates <- data.frame(
    Arm_ID = c(
        paste(model_variables$cn_info$Chromosome, "p", sep = ""),
        paste(model_variables$cn_info$Chromosome, "q", sep = "")
    ),
    Chromosome = rep(model_variables$cn_info$Chromosome, 2),
    Bin_start = c(
        rep(1, length(model_variables$cn_info$Chromosome)),
        model_variables$cn_info$Centromere_location + 1
    ),
    Bin_end = c(
        model_variables$cn_info$Centromere_location,
        model_variables$cn_info$Bin_count
    ),
    s_rate = runif(2 * length(model_variables$cn_info$Chromosome), 1 / 1.2, 1.2)
)
```

### 2b. Driver gene selection rates

If `selection_model` = `driver-gene-selection` or `chrom-arm-and-driver-gene-selection`, then cancer is driven solely or partially by gains, losses and mutations of driver genes.

Each row in `table_gene_selection_rates` details the information for one driver gene.
Its name is listed in column `Gene_ID`, and its genomic location is recorded in columns `Chromosome` and `Bin`.
The gene's function as cancer driver is specified in column `Gene_role` (either `TSG` for Tumor Suppressor Genes or `ONCOGENE` for Oncogenes; other functions or dual roles are not currently supported), and its selection rate (> 1) is in column `s_rate`.

The impact of CNA events on the cell's fitness depends on the mutated gene's function.
For a TSG:

- Deletion of the wild-type alleles is advantageous.
- Amplification of the wild-type alleles is deleterious.
- Deletion of the mutant alleles is neutral.
- Mutation and amplification of the mutant alleles are advantageous.

On the other hand, for an OG:

- Amplification of the wild-type or mutant allele is advantageous.
- Deletion of the wild-type allele or the mutant allele is deleterious.
- Mutation is advantageous.

Similar to the chromosome arm model, the strength of the selection force depends on the distance between the selection rate to 1.

Here, we create three driver genes with random selection rates, including two TSGs and one OG.

```{r}
table_gene_selection_rates <- data.frame(
    Gene_ID = c("Driver_1", "Driver_2", "Driver_3"),
    Gene_role = c("TSG", "ONCOGENE", "TSG"),
    s_rate = runif(3, 1, 1.2),
    Chromosome = c(1, 2, 3),
    Bin = c(10, 20, 30)
)
```

### 2c. Update CINner model variables

We now update `model_variables` to include the selection rates with function `BUILD_driver_library`.
Only the relevant selection rate dataframes should be included.

```{r}
model_variables <- BUILD_driver_library(
    model_variables = model_variables,
    table_arm_selection_rates = table_arm_selection_rates,
    table_gene_selection_rates = table_gene_selection_rates
)
```

## 3. Initial cell population

We now specify the initial cell population. 
Each clone in this population is described by its CN profile and list of driver mutations.

The variable `CN_matrix` specifies the clone's CN profile, consisting of 5 columns: `Chromosome`, `Strand`, `Bin_start`, `Bin_end`, and `Allele`.
For convenience, we can use function `BUILD_cn_normal_autosomes` to build a normal genome consisting only of autosomes (chromosomes 1 to 22, each with 2 alleles A and B),
or `BUILD_cn_normal_XX` to build a normal female genome (chromosomes 1 to 22 and X, each with 2 alleles A and B),
or `BUILD_cn_normal_XY` to build a normal male genome (chromosome 1 to 22, each with 2 alleles A and B; and chromosomes X and Y, each with 1 allele A).

```{r}
CN_matrix <- BUILD_cn_normal_autosomes(model_variables$cn_info)
```

The variable `drivers` lists the driver mutations that are pre-existing in the clone.

```{r}
drivers <- list("Driver_1")
```

To add this clone to the initial cell population, we use function `BUILD_initial_population` to update `model_variables`.
Beside `CN_matrix` and `drivers`, we also need to specify its `cell_count`.

```{r}
model_variables <- BUILD_initial_population(
    model_variables = model_variables,
    cell_count = 20,
    CN_matrix = CN_matrix,
    drivers = list()
)
```

If the initial cell population consists of multiple clones, the function `BUILD_initial_population` can be repeated for each distinct clone with different `cell_count`, `CN_matrix` and `drivers`.

# Run CINner

## 1. Check CINner model parameters

Before running CINner, we need to check that the model parameters are correctly defined, otherwise CINner will run into errors.

```{r}
model_variables <- CHECK_model_variables(model_variables)
```

`model_variables` is a list object containing all the variables defined thus far.

```{r}
names(model_variables)
```

Interested readers can explore each entry, for instance information about the length (in bin count) and location of centromere for each chromosome:

```{r}
model_variables$cn_info
```

## 2. Make CINner simulations

The function `simulator_full_program` produces simulations according to the model variables listed in the csv files resulting from the previous section.

There are several options for conditioning on the simulations or requesting specific results:

- `model`: Includes the model parameters defined thus far.
- `n_simulations`: Number of simulations requested.
- `compute_parallel`: Simulations are produced sequentially if `FALSE`, or in parallel if `TRUE`. Default is `FALSE`.
- `n_cores`: Number of computer CPUs to use to produce simulations in parallel (therefore only applied when `compute_parallel`=`TRUE`). If `n_cores` is not specified when `compute_parallel`=`TRUE`, the algorithm uses all available CPU cores except one.
- `seed`: Seed to produce replicable stochastic simulations. Only applicable when `compute_parallel`=`FALSE`.
- `report_progress`: The simulator prints updates of the progress if set to `TRUE`.
- `save_simulation`: All output variables from each simulation are saved in separate `rda` files if set to `TRUE`. Default is `TRUE`.
- `output_variables`: Vector of specific output variables from each simulation to return in the list format in R. Default is `NULL`, in which case no variable is returned.
- `folder_workplace`: Name of folder in the current directory to store output files from the simulations. If the folder does not exist, it will be created. Default is `NULL`, in which case files are saved within the current directory.
- `R_libPaths`: Name of folder where required R libraries are stored. Default is `NULL`, in which case the simulator assumes relevent R libraries are automatically usable.
- `n_clones_min`: Lower limit for number of clones at the ending time point for simulations to be accepted. Default is `0`.
- `n_clones_max`: Upper limit for number of clones at the ending time point for simulations to be accepted. Default is `Inf`.
- `neutral_variations`: Whether neutral CNAs are simulated on top of the selective CNAs.
- `save_newick_tree`: If `TRUE`, the phylogeny of sampled cells from each simulation is saved in the Newick format. Default is `FALSE`.
- `save_cn_profile`: If `TRUE`, the CN profiles of sampled cells from each simulation are saved in a csv file. Default is `FALSE`.
- `format_cn_profile`: If `long` when `save_cn_profile`=`TRUE`, the CN profiles are saved in the long format (subsequent cells are appended by row). If `wide` when `save_cn_profile`=`TRUE`, the CN profiles are saved in the wide format (each cell occupies a column). If `both` when `save_cn_profile`=`TRUE`, the CN profiles are saved in both formats (resulting in two csv files per simulation). Default is `long`.
- `save_cn_clones`: If `TRUE`, the assignment of which cell belongs in which clone is saved in a csv file. Default is `FALSE`.
- `internal_nodes_cn_info`: If `TRUE` when `save_cn_profile`=`TRUE`, the CN profiles of both the sampled cells and the internal nodes of their phylogeny are saved in the requested format(s). The internal node labels correspond to those in the Newick tree if `save_newick_tree`=`TRUE`. Default is `FALSE`.
- `model_readcount`: If `TRUE`, noisy readcounts are simulated from each sampled cell's CN profile and saved in a csv file. Default is `FALSE`.
- `model_readcount_base`: If `truth` when `model_readcount`=`TRUE`, noisy readcounts are simulated from the CN profile without neutral variations. If `neuvar` when `model_readcount`=`TRUE`, noisy readcounts are simulated from the CN profile with neutral variations. Both are simulated and saved in separate csv files if `model_readcount_base`=`all` when `model_readcount`=`TRUE`. Default is `all`.
- `HMM`: If `TRUE`, the cell's CN profiles are inferred back from the simulated noisy readcounts using HMMcopy. Default is `FALSE`.
- `HMM_containner`: Specifies which HMMcopy container is used when `HMM`=`TRUE`. Two available options are `singularity` and `docker`, which might have different efficiency.
- `pseudo_corrected_readcount`: if `TRUE`, the pseudo-corrected readcounts (= cell's HMM-inferred mean readcount X bin GC level) are computed and saved in a csv file. The specific data used depends on `model_readcount_base`. Default is `FALSE`.

Here we make 8 CINner simulations in parallel.
Each simulation is performed with `stage_final` = 4,
i.e. CINner runs all four main steps (clonal evolution, sampling, sample phylogeny, and neutral variations).

```{r}
CINner_simulations <- simulator_full_program(
    model = model_variables,
    n_simulations = 8,
    stage_final = 4,
    compute_parallel = TRUE
)
```

`CINner_simulations` is a list object, where each entry is one simulation.
We now explore the output data from the first simulation.

```{r}
names(CINner_simulations[[1]])
```

### 2a. Accessing CINner simulations' model variables

`CINner_simulations[[1]]$parameters` contains the model parameters used in the simulation.
This should be the same as `model_variables` that we input in CINner earlier.

```{r}
names(CINner_simulations[[1]]$parameters)
```

### 2b. Accessing CINner simulations' clonal evolution information

`CINner_simulations[[1]]$clonal_evolution` contains information from CINner's first step (clonal evolution).

```{r}
names(CINner_simulations[[1]]$clonal_evolution)
```

`genotype_list_ploidy_chrom`, `genotype_list_ploidy_block`, `genotype_list_ploidy_allele`,
`genotype_list_WGD_count`, `genotype_list_driver_count`, `genotype_list_driver_map` and `genotype_list_selection_rate`
contain information for every clone that arises during the simulation.

For instance, the 10th clone to arrive has the following counts of chromosomal homologs:

```{r}
CINner_simulations[[1]]$clonal_evolution$genotype_list_ploidy_chrom[[10]]
```

Its bin-specific CN of the first homolog of chromosome 2 is:

```{r}
CINner_simulations[[1]]$clonal_evolution$genotype_list_ploidy_block[[10]][[2]][[1]]
```

The number of WGD events in this clone is:

```{r}
CINner_simulations[[1]]$clonal_evolution$genotype_list_WGD_count[[10]]
```

The count and information of driver mutations in this clone can be accessed by:

```{r}
CINner_simulations[[1]]$clonal_evolution$genotype_list_driver_count[[10]]
CINner_simulations[[1]]$clonal_evolution$genotype_list_driver_map[[10]]
```

And finally its fitness:

```{r}
CINner_simulations[[1]]$clonal_evolution$genotype_list_selection_rate[[10]]
```

### 2c. Accessing CINner simulations' sampling information

`CINner_simulations[[1]]$sample` contains information from CINner's second step (sampling).

```{r}
names(CINner_simulations[[1]]$sample)
```

The most relevant information includes the assignment of each sampled cell to a clone:

```{r}
head(CINner_simulations[[1]]$sample$table_cell_clone)
```

The clonal letter ID can be traced back to specific genotypes from the first step by comparing with:

```{r}
CINner_simulations[[1]]$clonal_evolution$table_clone_ID_vs_letters
```

Each clone's CN and driver mutations can then be looked up in `genotype_list_ploidy_chrom`, `genotype_list_ploidy_block`, `genotype_list_ploidy_allele`,
`genotype_list_WGD_count`, `genotype_list_driver_count`, `genotype_list_driver_map`, as in Section 2b.

### 2d. Accessing CINner simulations' sampled cell phylogeny

`CINner_simulations[[1]]$sample_phylogeny` contains information from CINner's third step (sample phylogeny).

```{r}
names(CINner_simulations[[1]]$sample_phylogeny)
```

The object `CINner_simulations[[1]]$sample_phylogeny$phylogeny_clustering_truth$tree`
contains the simulated phylogeny of the sampled cells from Section 2c, in the `phylo` format:

```{r}
CINner_simulations[[1]]$sample_phylogeny$phylogeny_clustering_truth$tree
```

### 2e. Accessing CINner simulations' neutral variations

`CINner_simulations[[1]]$neutral_variations` contains information from CINner's forth step (neutral variations).

```{r}
names(CINner_simulations[[1]]$neutral_variations)
```

Each object contains information in similar format to Sections 2b-d, except with neutral CNAs and passenger mutations imposed on the sampled cell phylogeny.
